## Bit By Bit Developers Base Algorithms for CAD library

<img src="https://app.bitbybit.dev/assets/git-cover.png" alt="Picture showing bitbybit.dev platform">

This package contains base algorithms for our CAD platform. It has various helper functions for math, text, lists, vectors, matrix operations. It also contains some base types used accross bitbybit.dev platform on higher levels. This layer should be kept as lightweight as possible and ideally not contain any third-party dependencies as they just add to the weight and complexity.

This package should work in Node and browser based applications and should provide generic layer which could be helpful to all higher-level CAD algorithms and kernels. Algorithms of this base layer are also exposed on our bitbybit.dev Rete, Blockly & Monaco editors.

## Principles
Bit By Bit Developers company will keep these core algorithms that you can find in this repository free and opensource for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from public.

## About Bit By Bit Developers platform
Bit By Bit Developers web platform allows creators to program geometry through simple visual programming language or choose monaco typescript editor with full intellisense of bitbybit API. This cloud platform can fulfil many practical, educational and artistic needs of its users. Through familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.
