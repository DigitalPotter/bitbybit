This project exposes 3D algorithms based on OPENJSCAD 3D CAD kernel, which you can find on https://github.com/jscad. Bit By Bit Developers platform integrates this kernel into it's platform via this library. Currently we try to expose JSCAD library 1:1 in terms of functionality through our structured API, but as time goes we will have more unique algorithms in this package, which will be tuned specifically to our users.

## Principles
Bit By Bit Developers company will keep these core algorithms that you can find in this repository free and opensource for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from public.

## About Bit By Bit Developers platform
Bit By Bit Developers web platform allows creators to program geometry through simple visual programming language or choose monaco typescript editor with full intellisense of bitbybit API. This cloud platform can fulfil many practical, educational and artistic needs of its users. Through familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.
